# Thingspect API

This repository contains the API
[Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and
[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) definitions for the
[Thingspect](https://www.thingspect.com/) Atlas platform. API design is based
on the Google [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design).

## Getting Started

The Ruby package can be copied locally from this repository or regenerated using
the Protobuf definitions. See the
[gRPC Ruby quick start](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/ruby/quickstart/) for
more information.
